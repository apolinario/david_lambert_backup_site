# Personal Site

A personal diary/journal-style blog to:

- Document personal analysis & visualization projects in some sort of coherent manner
- Practice, hone, develop, etc. skills in R, Stata, etc.
- Get more work with the [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) -> HTML pipeline
- Work with [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) & [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (using the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic) in this case)
- Keep HTML/CSS skills sharp
- Maybe use as a space to develop some [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) skills
